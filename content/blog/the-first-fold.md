This blog didn’t begin with a plan.  
It began with potential—thoughts suspended in solution, fragments of memory, molecular metaphors, half-finished ideas.  
They floated there for years. Some came from textbooks, some from field notes, some from long walks and long silences.  
I didn’t know what they would become. But like proteins under the right conditions, they began to fold.

Each post here is a structure formed from contact—less a statement, more a shape.  
Welcome to the first unfolding.
